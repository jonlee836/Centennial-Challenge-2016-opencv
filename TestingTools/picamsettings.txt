List of Raspberry pi camera settings to try for opencv program.

For all settings I recommend using 30 fps and turning on camera stabilization for the pi cam.
This will reduce motion blur significantly.
30 frames processed per second is a waste, 5 is plenty.
Using waitKey(200) is appx 1/5 of a second.

OPTIONS

default sat, default contrast, min sharpness. This adds an interesting bluring effect that I think will help make the spotty paint 
look like 1 solid obj.
